# 2D Character Based on ChatGPT

Probably, you are bored by uselesslity of normal chat assistants
I tried to solve this problem, building this project powered by 3 biggest AI libraries: OpenAI, YOLO and sometime deepl

This project is my own and I kindly request that you do not copy it or list me as a co-author with a link to my GitHub for support. 

The project was built using Python version 3.10.
